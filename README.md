# Event Bubbling Demonstration

This project demonstrates the concept of **event bubbling** in JavaScript. It showcases how events propagate from child elements to parent elements in the DOM and how to manage event propagation effectively.

---

## Features

- Clear and concise demonstration of event bubbling.
- Examples to understand `stopPropagation()` and event delegation.
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly.
- Easily customizable for different event scenarios.

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anujshahmnnit/event-bubbling.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd event-bubbling
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

---

## Usage

### Basic Example
The project includes a simple HTML structure to demonstrate event bubbling. 

#### Example Structure:
```html
<div id="parent">
    <div id="child">
        <button id="button">Click Me</button>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Event Propagation Logic:
1. Events triggered on the button bubble up to the `child` and then to the `parent`.
2. Use `stopPropagation()` to stop the event from propagating further.

#### JavaScript Example:
```javascript
document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Parent clicked');
});

document.getElementById('child').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    console.log('Child clicked');
    event.stopPropagation(); // Stops bubbling to parent
});

document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Button clicked');
});
```

## Project Structure

```bash
event-bubbling/
├── index.html      # HTML file with the DOM structure
├── styles.css      # Optional CSS for styling
├── script.js       # JavaScript logic for event bubbling
└── README.md       # Project documentation
```

---

## Customization

- **Add More Elements:** Extend the HTML structure to test bubbling with additional elements.
- **Change Events:** Replace `click` events with other events like `mouseover` or `keydown`.
- **Event Delegation:** Add logic to demonstrate how parent elements can handle events for their children dynamically.

---

## Key Concepts

1. **Event Bubbling:** Events triggered on a child element propagate to its parent(s).
2. **stopPropagation():** Stops the bubbling of an event to parent elements.
3. **Event Delegation:** Use a parent element to manage events for dynamically added child elements.
